The proposition and body copy needs to make it clear what we are offering. Keep it simple, clear, and relevant. Use statistics and numbers if it adds immediacy and gets the point across. Use it to expand the story in the headline. 3. Call to Action: This is the opportunity to convert the reader into our content or sales funnel.

We never apply this to more than 50% of the image area and bands can shift up and down. We do this by applying a layer above the image and setting the Blend Mode to 'Screen'. This allows the natural colour of the image to still come through. Motion Blur: To create a sense of motion, where desirable, we can add horizontal motion blur to images. This is a useful tool to create greater visual interest and convey speed and energy. Image Pairing: We experiment with dynamic pairings. The use of colour, scale, motion blur, and interesting cropping aids in delivering Power in Action. A print test must be conducted for any large scale printing jobs.

Home environment: A Merlin Power space, such as our website, on our social channels, or showroom. We are already in a Merlin Power branded environment so communications don't require further application of logos. Away environment: An external space such as an exhibition, a digital ad, or a social media post on LinkedIn or Instagram that isn’t appearing on our feed directly (e.g., a promoted or sponsored post). In these instances, we apply our logo. In these examples: 1. Home, no additional branding required. 1. Home, featuring M Icon. 2. Away, featuring Logo.",
